  The pitch by pitch Statcast data was gathered from baseballsavant.com via the Search page. We downloaded the data in .csv format. Due to the number of observations, we downloaded the pitches one week at a time. We then combined the data sets into an .rda file that contains all 743,495 pitches from the 2019 season.

  The team data was obtained from www.fangraphs.com, a website meant for hobbyists to explore data within baseball. After navigating to teams screen, we chose multiple seasons of data (2010-2019) and checked the "split seasons" button in order to have a different row for every season for each team, as opposed to aggregating each teams data over those years. The export data button downloads this file as a ready to use .csv file that we import after putting into the correct directory.

```

After loading in the pbp2019 data set that will be used throughout this analysis, we will first examine the missing values. The data set has too many features to make use of a graph, but a few clear trends exist after looking at the column missing values and taking a look at the data. Many variables such as pitcher, batter, strikes, and balls, have no missing values, while others have large amounts. The explanation for this is inuitive: each pitch represents a row of data and the values without missing values are the values that exist no matter the outcome of the pitch. While many of the variables missing many values depend on the outcome of the pitch. A couple examples: launch_angle will not be present if the ball was not hit. on_2b will not be present if no one is on second base.

Interestingly, we see related variables share the same values of missing variables, such as all of the fielder_ variables having a missing value of 3159. The best explanation of this is that some ballparks (games in different countries) may not have measured these variables. 

After looking at the colMeans, we see that a few variables are missing for every value in the dataset, so we drop them from the data frame. 
```{r}
load('pbp2019.rda')
pbp2019[pbp2019=='null']<- NA
head(pbp2019,5)
colSums(is.na(pbp2019)) %>% sort(decreasing=TRUE)
tidy_data <- pbp2019 %>% gather(key='row',value = 'value', -sv_id) %>% mutate(missing= ifelse(is.na(value),'yes','no'))
colMeans(is.na(pbp2019))

drop <- c('spin_dir', 'spin_rate_deprecated','break_angle_deprecated','break_length_deprecated','tfs_deprecated','tfs_zulu_deprecated','umpire')
pbp2019 <- pbp2019[,!(names(pbp2019) %in% drop)]

```

```{r} 
# read in season data frame
season_data <- read.csv('FanGraphs_Leaderboard.csv')
head(season_data,10)
colnames(season_data)[1] <- 'Season'
season_data[season_data=='null']<- NA
colSums(is.na(season_data)) %>% sort(decreasing=TRUE)
```

An often noted trend in the MLB has been the increase in home runs, so we will look at a histogram faceted by season to see if teams tended to hit more home runs in recent years than previously. Clearly, this trend is noted for a reason as the histogram dramatically shifts over the years.  
```{r}
ggplot(season_data)+
  geom_histogram(aes(x = HR))+
  facet_wrap(~Season)
```


Next, we would like to examine swing rates. There is a general sense in baseball that pinch hitters are more likely to swing away. To test this thought, we first need to identify pinch hitters. Note the data does not give this information directly. So, we will use the game information - namely the players currently on the field - to determine when a batter enters the game before being on the field. Since the data does not provide information on the designated hitter, this method will not work for games played in American League ballparks. This should not be a major problem, however, as most pinch hitting happens in the National League anyway. The following code performs the task of identifying pinch hitters and creates an indicator variable "ph.".

```{r}
# sort pitches sequentially within each game
pbp_ordered <- pbp2019 %>%
  mutate(game_date = as.Date(game_date, "%m/%d/%Y")) %>%
  arrange(game_date, home_team, inning, desc(inning_topbot), at_bat_number, pitch_number)

# restrict to NL games since no info on DH
nl_games <- pbp_ordered %>%
  filter(home_team %in% c("NYM","WSH","PHI","MIA","ATL",
                          "CHC","CIN","STL","PIT","MIL",
                          "ARI","LAD","SF","COL","SD"))

# determine whether pinch hitter
nl_games$ph <- NA
nl_games_ph <- as.list(nl_games)
for(row in 1:nrow(nl_games)){
  if(nl_games_ph$inning[row] == 1 & nl_games_ph$inning_topbot[row] == "Top"){
    nl_games_ph$ph[row] <- 0
  } else{
    if(nl_games_ph$inning_topbot[row] != nl_games_ph$inning_topbot[row-1]){
      fielders <- list(as.character(nl_games_ph$pitcher.1[row-1]), nl_games_ph$fielder_2.1[row-1],
                       nl_games_ph$fielder_3[row-1] ,nl_games_ph$fielder_4[row-1],
                       nl_games_ph$fielder_5[row-1], nl_games_ph$fielder_6[row-1],
                       nl_games_ph$fielder_7[row-1], nl_games_ph$fielder_8[row-1],
                       nl_games_ph$fielder_9[row-1])
    }
    nl_games_ph$ph[row] <- ifelse(as.character(nl_games_ph$batter[row]) %in% fielders,0,1)
  }
}
nl_games_ph <- as.data.frame(nl_games_ph)    
```

To confirm the process works, consider the 6 most common batters among pinch hitters. Remember that the total shown is pitches, not plate appearances.

```{r}
nl_games_ph %>%
  filter(ph == 1) %>%
  group_by(batter) %>%
  summarize(pitches = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(pitches)) %>%
  head()
```

The player ids given correspond to Matt Joyce, Curtis Granderson, Jose Martinez, Tyler Austin, Charlie Culberson, and Greg Garcia. All but Martinez were in the top 10 in pinch hitting plate appearances in the regular season, and Martinez had many at bats off the bench in the playoffs, so the total pitches numbers line up. Now, we define an indicator to detect swings.

```{r}
nl_games_ph_swings <- nl_games_ph %>%
  filter(!(description %in% c("bunt_foul_tip","foul_bunt","missed_bunt",
                              "pitchout","hit_by_pitch"))) %>%
  mutate(swing = ifelse(description %in% c("foul","foul_tip","hit_into_play",
                                           "hit_into_play_no_out","hit_into_play_score"),1,0))
```

Now, we compare swing rates under different situations. Note we will define a few labels for brevity:

first: first pitch of the plate appearance

risp: runners in scoring position

late: in the 7th inning or later

The graph at the end of the section provides a summary of the pinch hitter splits for each category.

```{r}
# all
nl_games_ph_swings %>%
  group_by(ph) %>%
  summarize(pitches = n(),
            swing_rate = sum(swing) / pitches)

  filter(pitch_number == 1) %>%
  group_by(ph) %>%
  summarize(pitches = n(),
            swing_rate = sum(swing) / pitches)

# risp
nl_games_ph_swings %>%
  filter(on_2b != "null" | on_3b != "null") %>%
  group_by(ph) %>%
  summarize(pitches = n(),
            swing_rate = sum(swing) / pitches)

nl_games_ph_swings %>%
  filter(on_2b != "null" | on_3b != "null", pitch_number == 1) %>%
  group_by(ph) %>%
  summarize(pitches = n(),
            swing_rate = sum(swing) / pitches)

# late
nl_games_ph_swings %>%
  filter(inning >= 7) %>%
  group_by(ph) %>%
  summarize(pitches = n(),
            swing_rate = sum(swing) / pitches)

# risp, late
nl_games_ph_swings %>%
  filter(inning >= 7, on_2b != "null" | on_3b != "null") %>%
  group_by(ph) %>%
  summarize(pitches = n(),
            swing_rate = sum(swing) / pitches)

# risp, late, first
nl_games_ph_swings %>%
  filter(inning >= 7, on_2b != "null" | on_3b != "null", pitch_number == 1) %>%

  summarize(pitches = n(),
            swing_rate = sum(swing) / pitches)

# create data frame with results
df <- data.frame(situation = c("all","all","first","first",
                               "risp","risp","risp + first","risp + first",
                               "late","late","risp + late","risp + late",
                               "risp + late + first","risp + late + first"),
                 ph = factor(c(0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1)),
                 swing_rate = c(.363,.340,.230,.201,.380,.351,.266,.212,
                                .362,.337,.377,.344,.263,.206))

# cleveland dot plot
theme_dotplot <- theme_bw(15) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = rel(.75)),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = rel(.75)),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(size = 0.5),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())

ggplot(df, aes(x = swing_rate,
               y = fct_reorder2(situation,
                                ph == "1",
                                swing_rate,
                                .desc = FALSE),
               color = ph)) +

  scale_color_manual(labels = c("No", "Yes"), values = c("darkorange", "blue")) +
  theme_dotplot

```

Surprisingly, in every case the swing rate is lower for pinch hitters. This contradicts the initial theory. Also, the swing rates among categories have the same sorted order, with more swings occuring with runners in scoring position and less swings on the first pitch.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
balls <- pbp2019$balls

strikes <- pbp2019$strikes



pbp2019[balls == 2,]

twotwocount <- pbp2019[strikes && balls == 2,]


twotwocountplay <- twotwocount$description 
twotwocountplay1 <- data.frame(twotwocountplay)


ggplot(twotwocountplay1, aes(twotwocountplay))+
  geom_bar()
```

We were surprised that a 3rd ball was by far the most popular outcome during a 2 2 pitch. A foul ball was also very popular as the batter is trying to "protect the plate", which means that the batter is not as passive compared to an 0 0 count when they would be free to take a pitch as a called strike if it is not their preferred location. It is very interesting that a a called third strike was more popular an outcome than a swinging strike. This could mean that batters on avg are not protecting the plate as much as they are trying to earn a walk or to get a favorable 3 2 count where in many situations they will get a better pitch to hit through the heart of the zone when the pitcher doesn't want to risk walking them.
