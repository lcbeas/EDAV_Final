## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

After loading in the pbp2019 data set that will be used throughout this analysis, we will first examine the missing values. The data set has too many features to make use of a graph, but a few clear trends exist after looking at the column missing values and taking a look at the data. Many variables such as pitcher, batter, strikes, and balls, have no missing values, while others have large amounts. The explanation for this is inuitive: each pitch represents a row of data and the values without missing values are the values that exist no matter the outcome of the pitch. While many of the variables missing many values depend on the outcome of the pitch. A couple examples: launch_angle will not be present if the ball was not hit. on_2b will not be present if no one is on second base.

Interestingly, we see related variables share the same values of missing variables, such as all of the fielder_ variables having a missing value of 3159. The best explanation of this is that some ballparks (games in different countries) may not have measured these variables. 

After looking at the colMeans, we see that a few variables are missing for every value in the dataset, so we drop them from the data frame. 
```{r}
load('pbp2019.rda')
pbp2019[pbp2019=='null']<- NA
head(pbp2019,5)
colSums(is.na(pbp2019)) %>% sort(decreasing=TRUE)
tidy_data <- pbp2019 %>% gather(key='row',value = 'value', -sv_id) %>% mutate(missing= ifelse(is.na(value),'yes','no'))
colMeans(is.na(pbp2019))

drop <- c('spin_dir', 'spin_rate_deprecated','break_angle_deprecated','break_length_deprecated','tfs_deprecated','tfs_zulu_deprecated','umpire')
pbp2019 <- pbp2019[,!(names(pbp2019) %in% drop)]

```

The season data frame has no missing values.

```{r} 
# read in season data frame
season_data <- read.csv('FanGraphs_Leaderboard.csv')
head(season_data,10)
colnames(season_data)[1] <- 'Season'
season_data[season_data=='null']<- NA
colSums(is.na(season_data)) %>% sort(decreasing=TRUE)
```

An often noted trend in the MLB has been the increase in home runs, so we will look at a histogram faceted by season to see if teams tended to hit more home runs in recent years than previously. Clearly, this trend is noted for a reason as the histogram dramatically shifts over the years.  
```{r}
ggplot(season_data)+
  geom_histogram(aes(x = HR))+
  facet_wrap(~Season)
```

```{r}
ggplot(season_data)+
  geom_histogram(aes(x = AVG))+
  facet_wrap(~Team)
```
